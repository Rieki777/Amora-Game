/**
 * 0125, run against a village that already exists.
 *
 * The migration itself is a no-op on a fresh install: migrations run before
 * `seedEconomy`, so on a new instance there are no mint rules for it to touch
 * and the seed's own defaults are the whole story. That means the harness
 * proving "every migration applies from cold" proves nothing at all about what
 * this file DOES. It only proves the SQL parses.
 *
 * The case that matters is the one the file was written for: Amora, which
 * seeded its rules months ago and so will never see a new default from
 * `economySeed.ts` again, because money rules are INSERT IF ABSENT and are
 * never updated. This suite builds that village and runs the real file at it.
 *
 * And the case it must NOT touch: a village that has been paying its seat
 * holders in Gratitude for three moons. The founder's word was that Amora's
 * ledger is empty; this file does not take that on trust, it asks the ledger,
 * and this suite proves the question is actually being asked.
