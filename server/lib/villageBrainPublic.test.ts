/**
 * What the village brief hands to a prompt a STRANGER reaches.
 *
 * The brief has an `audience` column and a confirm step, and both mean nothing
 * until something reads them. `briefIndexForPrompt` hardcoded the ADMIN
 * audience because the founder's Setup Studio was its only caller, so wiring the
 * brief into the public guide without an audience parameter would have handed a
 * stranger the section names a village keeps private: `legal`, `constraints`,
 * `people`, `economy`. Leaking the shape of a secret is still leaking.
 *
 * Runs against the S5 harness, so every claim here needs the migration to have
 * run. No TEST_DATABASE_URL and the suite skips loudly.
