/**
 * ISSUANCE WAITS FOR THE VILLAGE (R67), proven against a real MySQL.
 *
 * This is the ONE suite that provisions with `gameStarted: false`, so it is
 * the only place the closed gate is visible. Everything it asserts is the
 * behaviour a brand new fork gets on its first day:
 *
 *  - a faucet posting is refused, and refused with a sentence a steward can
 *    read, before the launch ballot carries;
 *  - the refusal is a ROLLBACK: no ledger row, no balance, nothing to clean up;
 *  - a posting between two ordinary accounts is untouched, because moving
 *    tokens that already exist is not issuance;
 *  - recording the start opens it, once, and a second record leaves the first
 *    row exactly as it was.
 *
 * No TEST_DATABASE_URL: skips loudly, never passes hollowly (house rule).
