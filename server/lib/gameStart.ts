/**
 * HAS THIS VILLAGE'S GAME STARTED, and the one thing that answer gates.
 *
 * R67, in the founder's words: "A game needs 3 people minimum to play (to
 * actually issue tokens) so they can do everything else to set up the game on
 * their own, but once they press 'start the Game' this proposal to actually be
 * able to start minting tokens."
 *
 * So a village has a before and an after. Before, a founder builds the whole
 * Game alone: modules, dials, quests, seasons, every item on the launch
 * journey. Token issuance is the one power that waits, because a token issued
 * is a claim on everybody and everybody has not agreed yet. The launch ballot
 * carrying is the moment it turns on (`shared/ballotSubjects.ts`: 100 unity
 * and 100 quorum, with three people on the roll).
 *
 * ── WHERE THE GATE SITS, AND WHY THERE ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * In `postTransfer` and `postTransferPair`, on `ledger_accounts.faucet`.
 *
 * Issuance already has an exact definition in this codebase and it is a
 * column, not a convention: 0009 built the ledger double-entry so that
 * "designated FAUCET accounts may run negative, and their negative balance IS
 * the issuance-to-date figure". A posting out of a faucet creates tokens. A
 * posting between two ordinary accounts moves tokens that already exist.
 *
 * That distinction is what makes one gate enough. There are at least four
 * faucets and different systems read them: `sys:gratitude-pool`,
 * `sys:cycle-pool`, `sys:mint` and `sys:library-mint`. The admin mint cap sees
 * exactly one of those. A gate on the column sees all four, and it sees the
 * fifth on the day somebody adds it, with nobody having to remember. Spending,
 * swapping, refunding and every member-to-member send are untouched: a village
 * that has not started its Game has nothing to spend, so this takes nothing
 * away from anybody.
 *
 * ── WHY IT READS THE DATABASE INSTEAD OF A CACHED FLAG ──────────────────────
 *
 * The obvious build is `loadTokenRegistry`'s: read the answer at boot, hold it
 * in the module, check the variable. It is wrong here for two reasons, and the
 * second one is the serious one.
 *
 * A cached flag would be WRONG IN EVERY OTHER PROCESS the moment a launch vote
 * carries. The deployment can run more than one instance, and the one that
 * closed the ballot would start issuing while its sibling kept refusing, with
 * nothing to tell them apart from outside. The fix would be a cache-invalidation
 * channel between processes, for a value that changes once in a village's life.
 *
 * And an unloaded cache has to choose between refusing everything in any code
 * path that skipped boot, or issuing freely in one. Neither is a good answer to
 * a question the database can answer in a primary-key read.
 *
 * The read runs inside the posting's own transaction, after the accounts are
 * locked, so it sees committed truth and the decision cannot race the write it
 * guards. It costs one indexed lookup on a path that already runs several, and
 * only on postings that issue.

/**
 * WHETHER THE FOUNDER ROLE STILL CARRIES A POWER OF ITS OWN (R90).
 *
 * R90, in the founder's words: "The founder role disappears once the game
 * starts and a minimum of 3 people vote the game to start. After that they can
 * optionally vote in a steward role and give various powers to this steward to
 * immediately act."
 *
 * So launch is two facts landing in one moment. It was already the moment
 * issuance turns on (R67, R74). It is now also the moment the founder stops
 * being a standing power.
 *
 * ── WHAT ENDS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every power the `founder` account role carries BEYOND an administrator's.
 * After launch a founder is an administrator and nothing else: the mint back
 * door R85 asked for closes, the exclusive claim on who administers the
 * village ends, and the personal immunity that stopped an administrator
 * resetting a founder's password ends with it.
 *
 * ── WHAT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT END, AND THIS IS THE LOAD-BEARING HALF ───────
 *
 * The admin panel. R90 says a village may choose never to vote in a steward
 * and must still work completely, so the scaffolding cannot go away in the
 * same moment the founder does. Eighteen branches in `server/index.ts` read
 * `role === "admin" || role === "founder"` and mean one thing by it: is this
 * person an administrator. Ending those at launch would leave a village that
 * had just voted to start its Game unable to be administered at all, and with
 * no way back, because the route that appoints an administrator sits behind
 * the same admin check and the shared bootstrap password is spent. R89's end
 * state is a village with no admins, and it arrives by powers crossing to the
 * village one vote at a time.
 *
 * ── WHY IT READS THE SAME ROW AS EVERYTHING ELSE ────────────────────────────
 *
 * `readGameStart` is already the one answer to "has this village started", and
 * this file's header says at length why that answer is read from the database
 * rather than held in a module. A second copy of launch state, whether a
 * rewritten column on `users` or a flag set at close, is a second thing that
 * can disagree with the first, can half-apply across rows, and leaves no
 * record of which state was intended. So this is a read. There is nothing to
 * migrate and nothing that can drift.
