/**
 * OBJECTION LINEAGE, AND THE WORD THAT MEANS ITS OPPOSITE (0102).
 *
 * Two things are proven here against a real MySQL, and the first one matters
 * more than the feature it sits under.
 *
 * ── 1. `integrated` BLOCKS ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `OBJECTION_RULINGS` is `["integrated", "concern", "withdrawn"]`, and
 * `standingObjectionCount` counts `open` AND `integrated` as standing in the
 * way. `integrated` means the objection STANDS and the proposal must change.
 * Every everyday reading of the word says the opposite: integrated sounds like
 * folded in, dealt with, resolved. So the next person to touch this code will
 * read the blocking set as a bug and helpfully remove `integrated` from it,
 * and consent will start carrying decisions the village objected to. That is
 * a village's decision being wrong, which is the thing this whole engine is
 * for. This file drives it end to end: a consent ballot everybody voted yes
 * on, carrying one integrated objection, closes as FAILED.
 *
 * `server/lib/objectionLineageShape.test.ts` pins the same rule at the source
 * level so it fails even with no database configured. This is the behaviour.
 *
 * ── 2. THE LINEAGE EDGE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `ballot_objections.led_to_ballot_id` is one nullable pointer from an
 * objection to the ballot the amended proposal ran as. It is written once, at
 * the successor's open, guarded on `IS NULL` so the record keeps the first
 * answer and a second claim changes nothing. Provisioning this schema at all
 * is what proves 0102 applies, since the harness runs every migration through
 * the same engine production uses.
 *
 * No TEST_DATABASE_URL: skips loudly, never passes hollowly (house rule).
