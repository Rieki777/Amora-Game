/**
 * An outcome coming home, and the two ways it can fail to.
 *
 * THE MARKER IS THE WHOLE CONTRACT AND A HUMAN CAN DELETE IT. `hypha-bridge.ts`
 * says so in its own header: the platform puts `[gm:<id>]` into the Hypha
 * proposal title, and if anybody tidies that title before the vote the outcome
 * has nothing to match on. A title is a human field on somebody else's product
 * and treating it as a primary key was always going to lose one.
 *
 * So the strong key is the AGREEMENT ID Hypha returns at creation, which the
 * link step already stores on `mechanics_proposals.hypha_proposal_id` and which
 * the chain carries by itself. The marker stays as a fallback for a delivery
 * that carries no agreement id, which is the case the shipped bridge was built
 * around and which still has to keep working.
 *
 * And when neither matches, THE DELIVERY IS RECORDED AS AN ORPHAN rather than
 * answered and forgotten. A village should learn that a decision went missing
 * from a list it can look at, never from somebody asking why nothing applied.
 *
 * Everything here is pure. The store is `server/repos/hypha.ts` and the caller
 * hands in the two lookups, so a test can drive every branch with no database.

 * one hub carries many forks off one listener, so a routing mistake there is a
 * correctly signed delivery about somebody else's DAO. That is the failure this
 * closes, and it is the likeliest one precisely because the hub is one process
 * serving everybody.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT DO. A delivery that names no space cannot be checked, and this
 * returns `unstated` for it instead of pretending. The caller accepts those and
 * reports them, so an operator learns the check is idle rather than reading a
 * green that means nothing. Refusing them instead would take a working
 * integration down the first time a sender dropped an optional field.
