/**
 * Call synthesis (S54): the LLM turns a transcript into an overview,
 * chapters, decisions and task SUGGESTIONS — and the platform's job is to
 * keep it honest:
 *
 *   THE EVIDENCE RULE: a suggested task survives only with a verbatim quote
 *   AND a timestamp that the transcript actually contains, inside a ±30s
 *   window around the claimed moment. No quote, no timestamp, no match —
 *   DROPPED, and the drop is COUNTED and shown. Trust through visible
 *   discards.
 *
 *   DETERMINISTIC FIRST: chapter candidates and the role-candidate set are
 *   computed with zero tokens before the model runs; the model may only
 *   pick roles FROM that set — a hallucinated role id is nulled, exactly
 *   like the concierge discards invented match ids.
 *
 *   WRITE-ONCE AI BODIES: ai_body is set at INSERT and no code path updates
 *   it. Humans edit `body`; the pair is how the village learns what the
 *   machine gets wrong.
 *
 *   SUGGESTIONS NEVER TIMER-MUTATIONS: nothing in this file runs on a
 *   schedule, publishes, notifies, or moves value. Synthesis is an explicit
 *   admin act; publish is another one.
