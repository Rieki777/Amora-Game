/**
 * The season retrospective (Phase 3): the gap between what a pattern SAID the
 * village needed and what it actually used.
 *
 * This is the part of the season system worth building carefully, because it
 * is the only part that makes a pattern better than the day somebody wrote
 * it. A pattern that has run three times should be truer than any first
 * draft, and the only way that happens is if the close of each season hands
 * back evidence rather than a feeling.
 *
 * Same instinct as the concierge's unmatched-query log, which is reused here:
 * the system notices where reality and the written structure disagree, and
 * turns that into one action.
 *
 * Every read below answers a question a village would otherwise argue about,
 * and every one carries the ACTION it implies. A retrospective that only
 * describes is a report; one that offers the edit is a tool.
 *
 * Two rules this module holds to:
 *
 *  - Nothing here writes. It reads and proposes; a human accepts.
 *  - No composite score. Villages optimise whatever number is displayed, and
 *    a single "season health" figure would go green while the founder held
 *    everything. Each read stands on its own with its own honest null.
