/**
 * The outbound integration wrapper, and the health record it writes.
 *
 * Every call a module library driver makes to an outside service goes through
 * `callVendor`. Not "should": the wrapper is where the correlation id is
 * minted, where the header carrying it is built, and where the outcome is
 * recorded, so a driver that skips it produces no evidence at all and a
 * listing that forgets to instrument itself cannot exist.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A FIELD ON THE SECRET STATUS. `secretStatus.setAt` records
 * when a key was TYPED, never when it last worked. A revoked or expired
 * credential reads as connected forever under that field, which fails in the
 * worst direction on the single most common way an integration dies. The hard
 * rule, in code below and not only in a comment: nothing in this file infers
 * health from `setAt`, and with no recorded success the answer is
 * "never confirmed working" rather than "fine".
 *
 * The shape is `peer_instances`, which already carries last_sync_at,
 * last_error and a status written from ONE central place (the sync job)
 * rather than by each caller. Same discipline, one row per (module,
 * operation) instead of one per peer.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE. This is a rolling CURRENT-STATE record, one
 * row per (module, operation), overwritten in place. The per-call incident
 * log (request metadata, latency, outcome, one row per call, generalising
 * `payments_log`) and the scheduled liveness probe are a separate landing.
 * The correlation id is minted here anyway, because the id is what makes the
 * later log checkable against a vendor's own records.
 *
 * PRIVACY. Nothing written here carries a payload or member content. Status,
 * a short detail string, timestamps and a correlation id: a row you would be
 * willing to show the vendor it describes.
