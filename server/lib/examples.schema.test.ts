/**
 * Does the seed survive the trip into the database?
 *
 * Every seed bug this feature has produced was the same shape: a field
 * authored in examples-seed.json that the seeder branch never writes, or a
 * value the schema will not take. `capacity` was seeded on every room, read
 * into the row type, and rendered nowhere. `startsAt`/`location`/`ctaLabel`
 * rode the event thread and no page read them. Fifteen health snapshots were
 * written to a table whose only reader filters them out. None of it failed a
 * test, because every test asserted behaviour the seed already had.
 *
 * This suite asserts the CONTRACT between the two files instead: seed one
 * module at a time, then walk every field the JSON declares and check it
 * against the row that came out. A field with a matching column must have
 * arrived intact. A field with no column at all is either a known derived
 * input or a promise nobody keeps, and the allow-list below is where that
 * distinction is written down and defended.
 *
 * Skips loudly without TEST_DATABASE_URL, like every DB-backed suite here.
