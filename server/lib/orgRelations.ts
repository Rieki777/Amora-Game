/**
 * Links between org nodes, of types the village names itself (0054).
 *
 * Peerdom's lesson: an organisation defines its own relationship vocabulary
 * instead of receiving an enum. A village will ask for deputy, mentor,
 * successor and prerequisite, then two more nobody predicted, and shipping each
 * as its own column is six migrations for one idea.
 *
 * ── ENDPOINTS ARE NODES, NEVER PEOPLE ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * There is no `user` endpoint kind and adding one would be a different feature
 * with its own consent question. "Ada mentors Bo" is a statement about two
 * people that would then have to be kept out of the public export by
 * filtering, and filtering is how leaks happen. "The Water Steward seat is
 * deputised by the Gate Steward seat" says the useful part, outlives both
 * holders, and is publishable BY CONSTRUCTION.
 *
 * ── WHY `is_cover` EXISTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A generic link table with no semantics is a table nobody reads. The health
 * dashboard already reports seats with no second holder; a seat with a named
 * deputy is a materially different risk from one without. `is_cover` rides on
 * the TYPE, not on its label, so a village that renames "deputises for" to
 * "stands in for" keeps the meaning.
