/**
 * Which account a Google sign-in is allowed to become, and who may be sent a
 * set-password link. The decisions, with no Express and no database, so the
 * security argument is a test rather than a paragraph.
 *
 * ── WHERE THE LINK IS STORED, AND WHY IT IS SIGNED ──────────────────────────
 *
 * The link lives at `prefs.googleLink` on the member record. `prefs` is an
 * existing JSON column the members repository already round-trips, so this
 * lane adds no migration and no new column. That choice has a cost and the
 * cost is paid here in full.
 *
 * The cost: `PUT /api/profile/prefs` lets a signed-in member write whatever
 * they like UNDER `prefs.notify`. Top-level keys are not member-writable
 * today, so `prefs.googleLink` is out of reach. Today. A single future edit to
 * that handler, of the shape `u.prefs = { ...u.prefs, ...req.body }`, would
 * turn a preferences change into whole-account takeover of anybody whose
 * Google subject the attacker could guess, and nothing in that diff would look
 * like an authentication change.
 *
 * So the stored value is NOT TRUSTED. Every link carries an HMAC over the
 * member id, the Google subject and the timestamp, keyed by the same secret
 * that signs session tokens, and `readGoogleLink` recomputes it on every
 * single read. A member who writes their own `prefs.googleLink` produces a
 * record that fails verification and is treated as absent. The storage medium
 * became untrusted input, which is what it always was.
 *
 * THE FOLLOW-UP THIS DOES NOT DO. A real `google_sub` column with a UNIQUE
 * index would additionally make "one Google account reaches at most one
 * member" a database invariant instead of a check made just before a write.
 * The residual gap is named under `decideGoogleSignIn`.

/**
 * The whole account-linking policy, in one function with no side effects.
 *
 * ── THE QUESTION THIS ANSWERS, AND THE DEFENCE ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * A Google sign-in arrives whose verified email matches an existing account
 * that has a password. Link, or refuse?
 *
 * LINK. The argument is not convenience, it is that refusing buys nothing.
 * Google has told us this person controls that mailbox
 * (`email_verified: true`, enforced in oauthGoogle.ts and a precondition of
 * calling this function). Anybody who controls that mailbox can already take
 * the account by asking for a password reset and clicking the link that
 * arrives. So linking grants no power that the mailbox did not already carry.
 * Refusing would lock real members out of accounts they own while leaving the
 * mailbox path exactly as open as it was.
 *
 * THAT ARGUMENT HAS A PRECONDITION, and this lane had to build it. The reset
 * path has to actually work for the account in question. For an account with
 * no password hash it did not: `forgot-password` sent nothing and answered
 * success, forever. That is fixed in the same change (see
 * `maySendSetPasswordLink`), which is what makes "the mailbox could already do
 * this" true for every account rather than most of them.
 *
 * WHAT IS REFUSED, and why each one:
 *
 *  - An account already linked to a DIFFERENT Google subject. Two Google
 *    accounts reaching one village account means either a stale link or an
 *    attempt to attach a second credential to somebody else's account. The
 *    member unlinks the old one first, deliberately, through a route that
 *    knows who they are.
 *  - An example identity or a tombstone. Neither is a person.
 *
 * MATCHING IS BY SUBJECT FIRST, EMAIL SECOND. Google's `sub` is the stable
 * identity and an email address is a mutable attribute of it. A member who
 * changes their Google address keeps their village account, because the
 * subject still matches. The email is consulted only when no account carries
 * this subject yet.
 *
 * THE RESIDUAL RACE, named rather than hidden: two callbacks for the same new
 * Google subject arriving at the same instant both read "no account" and both
 * create one, leaving two member records for one Google identity. There is no
 * unique index behind `prefs.googleLink` to refuse the second. It needs a
 * double click at exactly the wrong millisecond, it degrades to a duplicate
 * account and never to a takeover, and the fix is the `google_sub` column
 * named at the top of this file.

/**
 * May this address be sent a set-password link, and which letter is it.
 *
 * ── THE BUG THIS REPLACES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` guarded its whole body on
 * `if (user?.passwordHash)`. An account with no password hash therefore got
 * the cheerful "if an account exists, a link is on its way" answer and NO
 * EMAIL, on every attempt, forever. The comment beside it said bootstrap
 * covered that case. Bootstrap needs `ADMIN_PASSWORD` from the environment and
 * refuses outright once any founder exists, so for an ordinary member in that
 * state it covers nothing at all. The founder of the live deployment is in
 * exactly this state today.
 *
 * ── AN EMPTY STATE AND A REAL ZERO ARE DIFFERENT FACTS ──────────────────────
 *
 * Three different accounts have `passwordHash === ""`, and the old guard could
 * not tell them apart because falsiness is not a fact about any of them:
 *
 *   1. A member who never set one. A real person who must be able to recover.
 *   2. A standing example identity. Never a person, never signs in.
 *   3. A tombstone, a member who asked to be forgotten.
 *
 * So the rule is written on positive facts about each. Examples are marked
 * `isExample`. Tombstones carry a rewritten `@anonymized.invalid` address, and
 * are additionally unreachable by any real address anyone could type. What is
 * left is case 1, and case 1 gets a claim link.
 *
 * ── THE ENUMERATION DEFENCE IS UNCHANGED ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This function decides what to SEND, and never what to answer. The route
 * answers one identical 200 to every caller: unknown address, example,
 * tombstone, claim-pending and ordinary reset all read the same from outside.
 * The only thing that varies is which letter arrives in a mailbox, and the
 * only person who sees that is whoever controls the mailbox. Both properties
 * hold at once, which is why this returns a `kind` and not a message.
