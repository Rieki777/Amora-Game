/**
 * The class tags on a seat, at the column level.
 *
 * Migration 0069 added `org_roles.archetypes` and `ROLE_COLS` did not select
 * it, which is the same shape the recruitment pack was in and which that
 * comment in orgChart.ts describes exactly: a column the API accepted and then
 * swallowed on the way back out. An end-to-end test over `/api/map` could not
 * have caught it either, because a route that never emits a field looks
 * identical to a village that has not tagged anything.
 *
 * So this reads the rows. It writes tags straight into the table and asserts
 * `listOrgRoles` hands them back, which is the only assertion that fails if
 * somebody trims `ROLE_COLS` again.
 *
 * THE EMPTY CASE IS THE POINT, not an edge. "Tagged for nobody" and "not
 * tagged at all" have to read the same way, because collapsing them the other
 * way is how a filter quietly empties a board, and both of them have to be
 * distinguishable from a tag list by the ONE branch every reader takes.
 *
 * Runs against the S5 harness: a scratch schema with every real migration
 * applied. No TEST_DATABASE_URL and the suite skips loudly (harness rule).
