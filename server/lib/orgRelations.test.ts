/**
 * Links a village names for itself, and the one rule that keeps them safe.

 * ENDPOINTS ARE NODES, NEVER PEOPLE. "Ada mentors Bo" would be a statement
 * about two people that then has to be kept out of the public export by
 * filtering, and filtering is how leaks happen. "The Water Steward seat is
 * deputised by the Gate Steward seat" says the useful part, outlives both
 * holders, and is publishable by construction. The type system carries that
 * rule (`NodeKind` has two values), and `relationProblem` enforces it against
 * anything arriving over HTTP.
