/**
 * A GIFT THAT NEVER ARRIVES, HELD SHUT ON BOTH GRATITUDE DOORS (R67).
 *
 * `sendGratitude` wrote the acknowledgement row and then asked the ledger to
 * issue. The row IS the spend: `budgetFor` sums `gratitude_log` for the cycle,
 * so a refused issue left a permanent record saying somebody gave something,
 * charged against their allowance, with nothing in the recipient's hands.
 *
 * The ledger refuses every faucet posting until a village's launch vote
 * carries, and under R67 that is every village until it launches. So this was
 * never only a crash window. It fired on every heart and every acknowledgement
 * a founder sent while setting their village up.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS SUITE ASSERTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE STATUS CODE ──────────────
 *
 * The response was already a refusal before the fix: a 500 carrying the
 * ledger's sentence. A test that read the response would have passed against
 * the broken code. What separates broken from fixed is the ROW COUNT and the
 * allowance, so that is what each case measures, on both doors:
 *
 *  - the forum heart (`POST /api/feed/threads/:id/heart`), which calls with
 *    `toId`, `kind: 'heart'` and a context;
 *  - the emailed acknowledgement (`POST /api/game/gratitude/send`), which
 *    calls with `toEmail` and the defaults.
 *
 * Both routes hand `outcome.error` straight to the member, so the sentence is
 * asserted too. The last case opens the gate and sends for real, which is the
 * control: a suite of two refusals proves only that something refused, and a
 * broken fixture refuses just as convincingly.
 *
 * No TEST_DATABASE_URL: skips loudly, never passes hollowly (house rule).
