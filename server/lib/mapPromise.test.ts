/**
 * Turning the map's key into a row, and the two words for having no row.
 *
 * `not-here` and `gone` are the whole reason this file exists. They look
 * interchangeable and they are not: one says a village has never brought the
 * scene across, which is the DEFAULT state of a fresh fork and the most common
 * answer the map will ever get; the other says the thing existed here and does
 * not now. Telling a first-time visitor that a gathering was deleted when it
 * was never adopted is the failure this pins.
 *
 * Runs against a real scratch schema because the discriminator is a query, and
 * a mocked pool would only prove I can write the mock I already imagined.
