/**
 * The meter, against a real schema.
 *
 * The properties worth a database are the ones a pure test cannot reach: that
 * the count SATURATES at one per member per module per cycle however hard a
 * module is hammered, that the seal leaves no member identity behind at all,
 * and that the reach fraction divides by the members who actually showed up.
 *
 * The saturation test is the important one. It is the whole anti-gaming
 * argument: if the two hundredth request of a cycle can move the number, then
 * a module that refreshes itself out-earns a module a village trusts, and the
 * pool pays for noise.
