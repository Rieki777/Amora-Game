/**
 * What a member may do in governance, and the drafts they leave behind.
 *
 * Five routes, lifted out of server/index.ts unchanged:
 *
 *   GET    /api/governance/standing     may I vote, what do I weigh, and why
 *   GET    /api/governance/wizard       what the wizard may offer today
 *   GET    /api/governance/drafts       my unfinished proposals
 *   POST   /api/governance/drafts       save and leave, and every autosave
 *   DELETE /api/governance/drafts/:id   discard one
 *
 * Five reads and writes about the member asking, which is what separates
 * this file from server/routes/governanceWeights.ts next door: those routes
 * allocate weight, these only report it.
 *
 * ALL FIVE MOUNT BEHIND requireModule("governance"), installed on the
 * /api/governance prefix in server/index.ts before this register() runs. The
 * module ships OFF, and while it is off every path here is a 404.
 *
 * `capabilityCtx` RATHER THAN A GATE, on purpose, and this is one of the few
 * places where that is the right call. Every route here asks a member ABOUT
 * themselves and refuses nobody on a capability, so there is no act to carry
 * a break-glass for. /standing's own comment says it at length: an admin
 * reading their own standing on a village-held key is told `false`, which is
 * the honest answer about who facilitates.
 *
 * REGISTERED WHERE IT WAS, because Express matches in registration order.
