/**
 * Ending a seating, and forgetting the person who held it.
 *
 * Two routes, lifted out of server/index.ts unchanged:
 *
 *   DELETE /api/admin/org/seatings/:id         end a live holding
 *   POST   /api/admin/org/seatings/:id/forget  take a documented name off
 *                                              every seat it appears on
 *
 * THE TWO DOORS ARE GATED DIFFERENTLY, ON PURPOSE, and the difference
 * survives the move unchanged. Ending a seating is `org.seat`, so a village
 * that has handed that key out can end its own holdings through the one gate.
 * Forgetting a holder is `isAdmin`, because deciding that two recorded names
 * are one person is a judgement, and the file's own comment below says why a
 * human stays in that loop.
 *
 * WHY THE REST OF THE ORG SURFACE IS STILL IN server/index.ts. The seat
 * lifecycle (claim, seat, release, the chart itself) reaches the capability
 * context and the org caches. These two reach `endSeating` and
 * `forgetDocumentedHolder` in server/lib/orgChart.ts and nothing else, which
 * is what made them separable first. A later lane taking the rest can fold
 * this file into it.
 *
 * ONE INLINE QUERY, against `org_role_assignments`, which is the table this
 * domain owns. It reads the seating before ending it so the journal line can
 * name the seat. That is why `getPool` is in the slice.
 *
 * REGISTERED WHERE IT WAS, because Express matches in registration order.

   * history and its count; only the person goes.
