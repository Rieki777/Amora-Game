/**
 * Tests for the quests + claims repositories, story layer included (0068).
 *
 * The story layer shipped with the write path widened from 18 columns to 25
 * and with two new aggregate queries behind the public life-signs endpoint,
 * and none of it had a test. A miscounted placeholder, a column written out of
 * order, or an example row leaking into a public count would all have passed
 * every gate, because nothing exercised this code.
 *
 * The round-trip cases below are deliberately written from the COLUMN LIST
 * rather than from the code that writes it: each one asserts a field survives
 * insert, select, and a mutation of some other field.
 *
 * Runs against the S5 harness: a scratch schema with every real migration
 * applied. No TEST_DATABASE_URL → the suite skips loudly (harness rule).
