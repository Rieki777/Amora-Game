/**
 * docs/TOKENS.md is checked against a real database and against the real code.
 *
 * `scripts/generate-token-doc.mjs` builds the document out of two kinds of
 * reading, and each one can be wrong in its own way:
 *
 *   1. It EVALUATES the token statements in `drizzle/` with a small SQL
 *      interpreter, because reading the INSERTs alone gets `transferable`
 *      wrong for the recognition token. An interpreter is a second
 *      implementation of MySQL's semantics, and a second implementation is a
 *      thing that disagrees with the first one eventually. So the first suite
 *      below runs every migration through the production engine and asserts
 *      the interpreter's rows are the database's rows, column by column. That
 *      is also what makes the `-- token-doc: as-if` escape hatch safe: a
 *      migration can tell the reader what it does, and a lie fails here.
 *
 *   2. It re-states, in the document's own words, what `faucetFor`,
 *      `spendSinkFor`, `sendRefusal` and `isPriceableToken` decide. Those
 *      restatements are read out of the source, so they cannot drift by
 *      accident, but they are still a paraphrase. The second suite calls the
 *      real functions with the real registry loaded and asserts the answers
 *      match, per token, so the paraphrase is checked rather than trusted.
 *
 * The third suite is the guard itself, run under `pnpm test` as well as in CI,
 * so a developer who never runs the check scripts by hand still hears about a
 * document that has come apart from the code.
