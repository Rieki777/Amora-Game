/**
 * The exit-code decision for a run that touched no database.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AS A UNIT TEST AND NOT AN E2E ONE. The behaviour under
 * test lives in vitest's own globalTeardown, so proving it end to end means
 * spawning a whole suite from inside a suite, twice, at about five minutes
 * each. `hollowRunVerdict` is the decision extracted as a pure function
 * precisely so the table below can be checked in milliseconds and read as a
 * table. The end-to-end proof (real `pnpm test`, real exit code, both with and
 * without a `.env`) was run by hand on 2026-09-02 and is recorded in the
 * commit message; this is what keeps the table from drifting afterwards.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT DB-GATED. A test about what happens when there is no
 * database must run when there is no database.
