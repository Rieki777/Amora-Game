/**
 * The page a founder or a member sees when a boot-time migration cannot
 * finish, instead of a bare 502 (item 3 of the data lane's Season 2 brief).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `applyPending` (migrate.ts) is fail-loud on purpose: a
 * server that starts serving over a schema its own migrations could not
 * finish would be worse than a server that refuses to start at all. But
 * "refuses to start" today means the process throws before it ever binds a
 * port. Railway retries three times, gives up, and every member sees a bare
 * 502 with nothing behind it. A non-technical steward has no way to tell a
 * failed update from the site simply being down, and nothing tells them what
 * to do next.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES INSTEAD. `startMaintenanceServer` binds the same port the
 * real app would have bound, and answers every request with one plain page:
 * an honest sentence about what happened, a statement that no data was lost
 * (migrations stop at the first failed statement, by design, and nothing
 * after that point ever ran), and the exact technical detail to hand to
 * whoever operates this deployment. `/health` and `/api/platform/info`
 * answer with JSON instead of HTML, in roughly the same shape the real
 * `/health` route uses (see server/index.ts), so a Railway health check or
 * the fleet roller's prober sees a clear non-ok status rather than a 404.
 *
 * WHO WIRES THIS IN. This module is deliberately self-contained: it takes an
 * `ApplyFailureDetail` and a port, and does not import anything from
 * server/index.ts, which the data lane does not own. The intended call site
 * is `startServer`'s migration step in server/index.ts, catching the case
 * `applyPending` already reports (`result.failed`/`result.failedDetail`):
 * call `startMaintenanceServer` with that detail instead of letting the
 * process throw and exit. Filed as a blocker for the lane that owns that
 * file; see SEASON2_FLEET_LEDGER.md section 6.
