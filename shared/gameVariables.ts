/**
 * THE VARIABLES REGISTRY: the foundation every other system reads from.
 *
 * Every tunable number, toggle, threshold and address in the game lives here as
 * data, editable from Admin, so a village customizes its game without a
 * developer and without a deploy. This is the layer that makes the platform
 * genuinely re-usable: two land projects running the same code can play very
 * different games purely by editing these values.
 *
 * The rule going forward: if a rule of the game is expressed as a literal in
 * code, it belongs here instead. `shared/gameConfig.ts` keeps IDENTITY (names,
 * paths, stage ladder, images); this file keeps BEHAVIOUR (how much, how often,
 * which mode).
 *
 * Values are stored as strings and parsed by `type`, so one table holds numbers,
 * booleans, choices and contract addresses without a column per kind. Regen
 * civics' equivalent table is numeric-only (`decimal(20,6)`), which cannot
 * express "equal voice or mirror Hypha" or an ERC-20 address; this shape can.
