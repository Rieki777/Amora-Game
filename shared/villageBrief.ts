/**
 * The village brief: what this village is for, as data (S74).
 *
 * The platform knew a village's configuration and never knew its purpose.
 * `app_config` holds content, faqs, brand, settings, visit-config and the rest,
 * all of it configuration and copy, and nothing held the aims. So the assistant
 * could describe what a module does and could not say which seat this village
 * is missing, because seats come from work that has to be held and nothing
 * recorded the work.
 *
 * One row per section, human-confirmed, fork-local, and never published. This
 * registry is the shape; `server/lib/villageBrain.ts` is the data layer.
 *
 * Audience is a column and not a convention: `people` names members and `legal`
 * names title holders, so neither may render to a member because a markdown
 * endpoint was easier to write without a filter.
