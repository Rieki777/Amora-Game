/**
 * THE FOUNDATION FONT CATALOGUE — what every village can choose from without
 * thinking about licences at all.
 *
 * Every offering here is SIL Open Font License, self-hosted via @fontsource
 * (imported in client/src/main.tsx, latin subset, bundled with content
 * hashes). Choosing one is therefore always legally safe and always fast —
 * no request leaves the origin for a typeface, anywhere on Earth.
 *
 * The catalogue is deliberately small and deliberately in one voice. The
 * platform's look is elegant-but-warm: a clean humanist display, a quiet
 * geometric body, a handwritten accent used sparingly. Every addition keeps
 * that register — offerings differ in mood (rooted, refined, airy), not in
 * kind. A catalogue of forty fonts is a design decision refused; twelve is a
 * design decision made.
 *
 * A village whose identity needs a face that is not here uploads its own
 * package (Admin → Typography) — with the licence acknowledgment that
 * transfers responsibility to the village that chose it, which is where it
 * belongs. This file is HARD-CLEAN territory: no village's name, ever.
 *
 * Adding an offering = one entry here + the matching latin-subset imports in
 * client/src/main.tsx. Nothing else; theme.css does the rest at runtime.
