/**
 * The powers page says who holds what, and puts no number on the page (0098).
 *
 * R55, the founder's ruling: the handover is a journey to celebrate and never
 * a scorecard to fail. A village holding two powers is young, and this page
 * has to feel good to a two-week-old village and a two-year-old one alike.
 * The inverse index is exactly the artifact that becomes a scorecard if it is
 * rendered carelessly, and "2 of 12 - 17%" is one careless afternoon away at
 * all times.
 *
 * Two halves. The sentences are pure and get exercised branch by branch. The
 * page itself is read as TEXT, which is what this repo's client tests can do
 * (there is no jsdom: vitest runs in a node environment and the client half of
 * the suite is pure logic). Reading the file is weaker than rendering it and
 * it catches the thing that actually happens, which is somebody typing a
 * percentage into a template.
