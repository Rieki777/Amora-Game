/**
 * The Setup Wizard has to survive being typed into.
 *
 * WHAT THE FOUNDER REPORTED. "Every time I type a single letter into the forms
 * here it takes down my dialogue keyboard box on mobile." One letter, keyboard
 * gone, on the first screen every new village meets.
 *
 * WHAT WAS ACTUALLY HAPPENING. `Section` was declared with `const Section =
 * ({...}) => ...` INSIDE `SetupWizard`'s body, so every render produced a new
 * function value, and a new function value is a new component TYPE. React
 * matches an element against the previous tree by type identity, and a type
 * that never matches cannot be updated, only replaced: the whole subtree is
 * unmounted and a fresh one mounted in its place. Typing a letter calls
 * `setField`, `setField` calls `setBrand`, the re-render throws away the
 * `<input>` the founder was typing into and inserts a different DOM node with
 * the same markup. A browser gives focus to a NODE, so focus dies with the old
 * node. On a desktop that reads as a cursor that will not stay put. On a phone
 * the on-screen keyboard is bound to the focused element, so it drops.
 *
 * WHY THE ASSERTIONS ARE ABOUT NODE IDENTITY AND NOT ABOUT A KEYBOARD. jsdom
 * has no on-screen keyboard to observe, and neither does any headless browser.
 * The keyboard is downstream of one fact the DOM does expose: whether the
 * element the founder focused is still the element in the document, still
 * focused, after the state update. Assert the cause, not the symptom, because
 * the cause is the thing a future edit can silently reintroduce.
 *
 * `toBe` and not `toEqual` throughout, deliberately. Two different `<input>`
 * nodes carrying identical attributes are `toEqual` each other and are exactly
 * the bug. Only reference identity can tell a survived node from a replacement.
 *
 * THIS TEST WAS RED FIRST. Run against the nested `Section`, the first
 * keystroke assertion failed with the input detached and `document.activeElement`
 * back on `<body>`. A regression test that has never failed is a test of
 * nothing.
