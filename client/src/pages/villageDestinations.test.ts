/**
 * No page may carry a destination belonging to one particular village.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHY IT IS NOT check-brand-refs.mjs. That guard exempts
 * the SHOPFRONT pages on purpose: a village's own prose is its own, and
 * policing thirteen pages for their own name taught nobody anything. The
 * exemption is right for names and wrong for destinations, and this is the
 * gap it left. Every mailto and every outbound link that shipped hardcoded
 * lived in a file that guard cannot see, so the whole defect class was
 * invisible to CI while looking fully covered.
 *
 * The harm is asymmetric, which is why the mail rule is the strict one. A
 * wrong URL is visibly wrong the moment somebody clicks it. A wrong mailto
 * opens an ordinary mail composer addressed to a village the visitor has
 * never heard of: they send their investment enquiry, see no error, and the
 * founder whose site it was never learns the lead existed.
 *
 * The fix these rules protect: identity lives in shared/gameConfig.ts, is
 * overlaid per village through the brand document, and is read at render
 * through useVillageLinks() in client/src/lib/gameApi.ts, which returns ""
 * for anything the village has not set so the control hides rather than
 * pointing somewhere else.
