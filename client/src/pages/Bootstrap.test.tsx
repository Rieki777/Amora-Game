/**
 * The claim page exists because two people have been locked out of their own
 * village this year, and both lockouts lasted days for the same reason: the
 * thing that refused them did not say which thing it was.
 *
 * So the contract these tests hold is not "the form submits". It is that every
 * refusal this endpoint can return produces a DIFFERENT, actionable sentence,
 * and that the bootstrap password never leaves the request body. A page that
 * answered all five refusals with "something went wrong" would pass a naive
 * render test and reproduce the outage it was built to end.
 *
 * `Layout` is mocked to a passthrough: the site shell is not what is under
 * test here.
