// @vitest-environment jsdom
/**
 * The homepage hero, and the difference between "no art yet" and "the art is
 * broken".
 *
 * Code that guards on falsiness cannot tell those two apart, and that is the
 * whole reason the live village looked broken: a village that had uploaded no
 * hero photograph got the same 32px picture-frame mark a 404 gets, drawn in
 * the middle of a 1272px hero. A visitor reads that as breakage. Nothing was
 * broken. Nothing had been added.
 *
 * So this file pins the two cases apart:
 *   no hero configured   -> no image, no mark, nothing announced
 *   hero configured      -> the image, and the mark only if it fails to load
 *
 * The four journey pages already drew nothing when there was no hero. This
 * page did not, and these tests are what stop it drifting back.
 *
 * The visual side (the accent word's contrast against the band behind it) is
 * NOT testable here: jsdom computes no colours through Tailwind's generated
 * utilities and does no compositing, so a ratio assertion would be measuring
 * the test's own arithmetic. That was measured in a real browser instead and
 * the numbers are in the lane report.
