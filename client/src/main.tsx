/**
 * SELF-HOSTED FONTS (was: a render-blocking Google Fonts <link> in index.html).
 *
 * Three reasons, each sufficient on its own:
 *  - Privacy: the old link sent every member's IP to Google on every page
 *    load. A German court (LG München, 2022) has already held that a GDPR
 *    violation — untenable for a platform sold as "your deployment, your
 *    data".
 *  - Reach: Google's font CDN is blocked in China. A village there simply
 *    could not load the typefaces.
 *  - Speed: two extra DNS+TLS handshakes to third parties before text could
 *    settle. Bundled woff2 rides the same origin with a content hash and a
 *    year-long cache, like every other asset.
 *
 * Latin subset only (covers Spanish: U+0000-00FF has á é í ó ú ñ ü). The old
 * link also fetched Cormorant Garamond in five variants — referenced by no
 * font stack anywhere in the client, so it is simply gone.
 *
 * Weights match what the Tailwind classes actually use (light..bold). Fonts
 * are declared with `font-display: swap` by @fontsource, so text renders in
 * the fallback immediately and never blocks on a font file.

/*

 * @font-face costs nothing at runtime: the browser downloads a file only
 * when an element actually renders in that family, so unchosen offerings are
 * a few hundred bytes of CSS, not font traffic. Display faces carry
 * 400–700; the body face carries the full working range; accents 400+700;
 * Marcellus is a single-weight face by design.
