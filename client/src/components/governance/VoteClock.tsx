/**
 * The live countdown on a decision in flight.
 *
 * Hypha ticks a one-second interval and force-updates the whole widget
 * (harvest section 2). This one asks voteBars.tickMsFor how often a second
 * could possibly matter and schedules only that: per second inside the last
 * hour, per minute inside the last day, every five minutes beyond. A ballot
 * nine days out does not need 777,600 re-renders to be honest, and a member
 * who asked for less motion should not get a digit twitching at them for a
 * week.
 *
 * The accessible name carries the span in WORDS ("2 days 3 hours left to
 * vote"), and the visible clock is aria-hidden: a screen reader announcing a
 * changing colon-separated string every second is unusable, and it was never
 * the information anyway.
