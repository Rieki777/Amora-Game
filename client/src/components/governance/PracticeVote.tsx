/**
 * A PRACTICE VOTE: the village asks itself something, for real, and nothing
 * moves.
 *
 * This is the founder-facing half of the advisory route. The type step used to
 * end four of its five cards in a locked rectangle saying this village cannot
 * open that kind of decision yet, which is true and is also a dead end: it
 * told a member what the village lacks and offered them nothing to do about
 * it. The same member can now put the same question to the whole village on
 * the real engine, with the real frozen roll and the real weights and a real
 * quorum to reach, and read a real answer that changes nothing on its own.
 *
 * WHY THAT IS WORTH BUILDING AND NOT A CONSOLATION PRIZE. The part of taking
 * a governance power that cannot be built for anybody is the nerve to use it.
 * A village that has watched its own quorum arrive, or fail to arrive, on a
 * question it cared about knows something it could not have been told. So the
 * engine underneath is deliberately identical to the binding one: practising
 * on a softer engine would teach the wrong lesson twice, once about how hard
 * quorum is and once about what its village actually thinks.
 *
 * THE WORDS ARE GOVERNED BY R55 AND R56. Nothing here counts what the village
 * has not got, ranks it, or implies it is behind: a village holding one
 * binding power is a village at the beginning of something, and a village of
 * ten years sounding out a hard question is doing the same act as a village of
 * ten days finding its feet. So this says what a practice vote IS and what
 * pressing the button does, and stops.
 *
 * THE METHOD IS OFFERED HERE and is not offered on a binding ballot, because
 * finding out how consent feels compared with majority is most of what a
 * village practises. Leaving it alone uses the village's own setting, which is
 * the honest default: the point is to feel what this village's own rules do.
 *
 * ── THE SECOND WAY IN: A FIXED ASK ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The module library opens this same screen with the question already written
 * (`asking`), because a member wanting a module their village does not run is
 * asking the village one answerable thing and the sentence is the same for
 * everybody who asks it. That sameness is load-bearing: an advisory ballot's
 * `subject_ref` is a server-side uuid, so the title is the only thing a second
 * asker can match on, and a member who reworded the sentence would ring the
 * whole roll a second time about one switch.
 *
 * `asking` is ONE object and never a scatter of optional strings, so there is
 * no half-configured state where a fixed question arrives under a heading
 * written for a free one. Absent, this is exactly the screen it was.
