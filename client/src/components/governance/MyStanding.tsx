/**
 * HOW MUCH YOU WEIGH, AND WHY.
 *
 * Custom mode is the sharp case: weight is allocated by a steward, one member
 * at a time, and allocated power that a member cannot see is exactly the thing
 * the constitution's new law was written against ("Voting weight is on the
 * record").
 *
 * The other two modes get the same card because the QUESTION is the same one,
 * and a member should not have to know which mode their village runs to find
 * out what their vote is worth. Equal mode answers "one person, one vote" and
 * is a short card. That shortness is the point: an honest surface for a simple
 * rule looks simple.
 *
 * A zero is stated, never left blank. In custom mode an absent allocation is
 * zero weight by design (fail closed), and a member holding zero has a real
 * grievance the interface should hand them instead of hiding it.
 *
 * THIS CARD CARRIED A TRAIL AND NO LONGER DOES, which is the whole of this
 * lane. It printed the viewer's own weight-change rows under "Every change to
 * it" while `WeightRecord` printed the village's append-only trail, which
 * CONTAINS those same rows, under "Every change". Two headings a few words
 * apart, one list nested inside the other, in one rail column. The two cards
 * landed an hour apart from two lanes and neither lane was placed to see the
 * pair.
 *
 * THE SHAPE CHOSEN: two cards, one job each, no shared rows. This card is the
 * near fact a member came for, and it is a fact, never a list: what you weigh,
 * under which rule, and what that weight is worth when a decision opens. The
 * trail is one list and lives once, in `WeightRecord`, where a row belonging
 * to the viewer now reads "You". Nothing left the page. The viewer's rows are
 * still on it, they still sit where they happened, and they now carry the name
 * of whoever made the change, which this card never showed.
 *
 * The merge was considered and refused: this card is on `/decisions/:id` too,
 * where the rail is deliberately about one vote, and a single card holding the
 * village's whole ledger would have to be the tallest thing on that page.
