/**
 * WHAT EVERYONE WEIGHS, WHO CHANGED IT, AND WHICH OF IT IS YOURS.
 *
 * `governance_weight_changes` is append-only and `GET /api/governance/weights`
 * serves it to any signed-in member, which is deliberate. The constitution's
 * line is "Voting weight is on the record... Weight is power, and this game
 * holds no hidden power", and a record only an admin can read is not a record.
 *
 * THIS IS THE ONLY WEIGHT TRAIL ON THE PAGE NOW. `MyStanding` used to print
 * the viewer's own rows under a heading of its own, and those rows are a
 * subset of this list, held in less detail: the same table, the same helper,
 * the same reasons, minus the name of whoever made the change. The reason
 * that second list existed is a good one and it is written down in the card
 * it came from: a member should not have to hunt for their first name in a
 * village-wide table. The answer is to stop making them hunt. A row that
 * belongs to the viewer reads "You" and stands where it happened, so the near
 * question and the village's question are answered by one list read once.
 *
 * WHICH ROWS ARE THE VIEWER'S IS DECIDED FAIL-CLOSED. This route serves first
 * names only, so a namesake is indistinguishable, and this is a surface about
 * who holds power: telling a member that somebody else's change was theirs is
 * worse than telling them nothing. `GET /api/governance/standing` hands the
 * viewer their own rows out of the same table through the same helper, so a
 * village row is claimed only when its (moment, from, to, reason) tuple is one
 * the viewer's own rows carry AND it matches exactly one row in this list. An
 * ambiguous pair stays unmarked and simply reads as itself.
 *
 * The allocation list above the trail is NOT marked, for the same reason
 * inverted: a current allocation carries no moment and no reason, so the only
 * thing to match on is a first name and a number, and two members on the same
 * weight are ordinary. An unmarked list of holders is honest; a wrong "You"
 * on it would not be.
 *
 * It shows itself only where it says something. Under one-person-one-vote
 * with nothing ever allocated there is no record to read, and a card that
 * printed "nothing here" beside a live vote would be furniture.
