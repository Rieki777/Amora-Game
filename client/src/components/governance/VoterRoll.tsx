/**
 * WHO MAY VOTE, and who has spoken.
 *
 * The engine freezes an electorate at open and stores each member's weight
 * beside their name. That roll is the answer to the question a member actually
 * has when they look at a live decision, which is not "what is the percentage"
 * but "who is this, and where do I sit in it".
 *
 * So this renders the WHOLE roll, not only the voters: everyone who has spoken
 * with what they said, then everyone the village is still waiting on. Hypha
 * ships a voter list (harvest section 2, `voter-list.vue`); the silent half is
 * ours, because a quorum bar that is short is a fact about specific people who
 * have not answered yet, and naming them is how a village chases a vote
 * instead of watching a bar.
 *
 * THIS VILLAGE DOES NOT RUN SECRET BALLOTS, and the card says so rather than
 * letting a member discover it after voting. Design section 9 names that as a
 * shipped limitation; a limitation nobody is told about is a trap.

 *
 * The FALLBACK below is for the case the compiler cannot see, which is the
 * one that took two pages down today. `v.choice` arrives over HTTP and is
 * typed by assertion, so `Record<Union, T>` types this index as total while
 * only asserting a claim about the server. A client build older than the
 * server it is talking to meets a choice this union never held, and read
