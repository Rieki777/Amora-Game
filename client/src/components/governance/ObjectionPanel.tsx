/**
 * CONSENT MODE: an objection is a contribution.
 *
 * Sociocracy 3.0's distinction, which the engine carries as rows: an
 * OBJECTION reveals a consequence or a risk the village would rather avoid,
 * and it blocks. A CONCERN is a worry that cannot be backed by reasoning or
 * evidence enough to qualify, and it does not block; it is recorded beside the
 * decision and rides into the review of whatever the decision produced.
 *
 * The design ruling this file answers to: filing an objection should feel like
 * contributing. Everything here follows from that.
 *
 *  - The invitation reads as an invitation. "Say what you see" rather than
 *    "block this proposal", because the person with the objection is usually
 *    the person who noticed something, and the interface should not make them
 *    feel like an obstacle for noticing.
 *  - An objection is shown with its author's name and its full text, at the
 *    same weight as the proposal itself. It is not a footnote under a bar.
 *  - Every ruling is shown WITH ITS REASONING, because the engine requires a
 *    note on every ruling and the whole value of that requirement is that
 *    somebody reads it. A facilitator who has to write down why they set an
 *    objection aside is a facilitator who thinks about it.
 *  - "Concern" is never rendered as a downgrade. It is a real outcome: the
 *    village heard it, it does not block, and it travels with the agreement.

/**
 * What each state of an objection means, and its authority is the server's
 * `OBJECTION_RULINGS` plus the `open` an insert writes (server/lib/ballots.ts).
 * `ballot_objections.status` is a varchar with no enum behind it, so the
 * database constrains nothing here and the route's own allow-list is the only
 * rule; governanceStates.test.ts reads that list and holds this map to it.
 *
 * The lookup takes a fallback for the same reason GameMechanics.tsx does.
 * `Record<Union, T>` types an index as total, so the compiler asserts a claim
 * about the server instead of checking one: the identical shape here threw
 * inside a list and took a whole page to the error boundary the first time a
 * status arrived that a hand-kept union had never heard of.
