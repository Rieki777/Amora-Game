/**
 * THE TWO PICTURES, drawn.
 *
 * One picture for agreement among those who voted, one for participation
 * against the whole electorate, and never a third that merges them. The
 * arithmetic and the wording live in voteBars.ts, tested; this file is the
 * drawing, and its only job is to keep the two apart on the page as firmly as
 * they are kept apart in the module.
 *
 * THE FOUNDER'S DESIGN, which is the spec:
 *
 *   > "for quorum a small icon with many silhouettes of people that fill up as
 *   > we get more of the quorum (what % of all voice tokens/voters) met and
 *   > unity (what % for or against) is a moon so a 80% threshold would show a
 *   > red line needing the moon to get to that 80% illumination (if first
 *   > person votes yes we're at 100% moon illumination but very little of the
 *   > silhouettes, etc."
 *
 * The last clause is the whole teaching, and it is why there are two shapes
 * and not two bars. A FULL MOON OVER AN ALMOST EMPTY FIELD is a picture a
 * member reads once and never has to be taught again: everyone who spoke
 * agrees, and hardly anyone has spoken. Two bars of different lengths say the
 * same thing and say it in a language that has to be learned. That sentence
 * ships on the page, in the explainer under both pictures.
 *
 * THIS SUPERSEDES THE EARLIER RULING IN THIS FILE, deliberately. The previous
 * comment argued that `MoonProgress` was for completion displays and that a
 * disc had nowhere to put a threshold. The second half was the real objection
 * and it is now false: `terminatorPath` draws the terminator the moon WOULD
 * have at the threshold, so the line and the lit edge are one curve at two
 * values, and the moon crossing it is exactly the number crossing.
 *
 * WHY THE FIELD IS ALWAYS GREY. It is tempting to turn it green when it
 * clears, and that is the bug: green on this page means "this is carrying",
 * and a met quorum means only that enough people showed up for the question to
 * be answerable. Its met state is carried by the notch, the check mark and the
 * sentence, which is what the accessibility rule asks for anyway.
 *
 * WHY A CONSENT BALLOT HAS NO MOON. `dialsForMethod` stores `unityPct: 0` for
 * consent and `evaluateBallot` returns on objections before unity is read at
 * all, so a moon there would draw a threshold that decides nothing. The
 * objection state stands in its place, beside the field, which DOES apply.
 * `objectionState` in voteBars.ts holds that reading.
 *
 * ACCESSIBILITY. Each picture is a `progressbar` with aria-valuenow and an
 * accessible name that already contains the number and the verdict, so a
 * screen reader never has to infer anything from a colour or a shape. The
 * threshold is drawn AND named in words. Every transition is dropped for
 * anyone who asked for less motion, and the value still lands.
