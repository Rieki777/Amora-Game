/**
 * THE FIELD OF SILHOUETTES: participation, drawn as the village showing up.
 *
 * The founder's design: "for quorum a small icon with many silhouettes of
 * people that fill up as we get more of the quorum (what % of all voice
 * tokens/voters) met". This is that icon, and four decisions carry it.
 *
 * A FIGURE IS A SHARE, NEVER A PERSON. Twenty figures, five percent of the
 * frozen total weight each, fixed for every village. The reasoning lives with
 * the arithmetic in `voteBars.ts` under `CROWD_FIGURES`, and the short version
 * is that under `token` weight mode one member can carry a hundred times
 * another's weight, so a field of one figure per member would fill by heads
 * and state something the ballot does not count. `crowdFill` says how full
 * each figure stands and `crowdFront` says where the wipe's edge is, so this
 * drawing has no arithmetic of its own.
 *
 * IT IS GREY, ALWAYS. Participation is not agreement. A field that turned
 * green when quorum cleared would tell a member "it passed" about a number
 * that only says the question is answerable. Its met state is carried by the
 * notch, by the mark glyph the caller draws, and by the sentence, which is
 * what the accessibility rule asks for anyway.
 *
 * THE NOTCH IS PLACED BY THE SAME FUNCTION AS THE FILL. Both go through
 * `crowdFront`, so the line sits exactly where the fill front would sit at the
 * threshold. Positioning the notch as a plain percentage of the row's width
 * would drift by however much gap sits between the figures, and by a different
 * amount at every value.
 *
 * MOTION. The field wipes when a vote lands, which is motion that answers the
 * person (`docs/modules/natural-interface.md`). It is one transform on one
 * clip rectangle, so nothing animates per figure, and the transition is
 * dropped for anyone who asked for less motion. The value still lands.
