/**
 * THE STEPPER: where you are in this type's walk, and how to get back.
 *
 * Hypha's `creation-stepper.vue` is a right rail of numbered circles that
 * become checkmarks, with click-back to any completed step, collapsing to a
 * row of dots on mobile (harvest section 1). This is that, with two changes
 * the house rules force and one the walker makes possible:
 *
 *  - CLICK-BACK ONLY. Jumping forward past an unanswered step is how a member
 *    reaches the review screen with three blanks and no idea which. Backward
 *    is always safe, so backward is what is offered.
 *  - THE STEPS ARE THE TYPE'S OWN. It renders `walkFor(type)`, already pruned,
 *    so a rule change shows four circles rather than five with one crossed
 *    out. Nobody has to explain a step that does not apply.
 *  - The list is an ordered list with aria-current on the step you are on, and
 *    every completed circle carries a check that survives greyscale.
