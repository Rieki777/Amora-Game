/**
 * The builders' pool statement (lane METER).
 *
 * R59, the founder: "Platform made modules can still earn ReGen to keep the
 * system flowing well but those earnings just cycle back into the bucket to
 * give out again next cycle." His instruction about this surface was that the
 * recycling be visible: "a village or an author should be able to see that the
 * platform's share went back in, not into our pocket." So the returning share
 * is a number on the page and never a footnote.
 *
 * R56: state what is true, then get out of the way. Every line here is a count
 * or an amount. There is no encouragement to use more modules, no health
 * colour, and no verdict on what any of it means.
 *
 * R55: never a scorecard. This shows one village its own reading and has no
 * access to any other village's, so there is nothing here to rank against and
 * no way to add one later without a new route. The modules are ordered by share
 * because a statement is ordered by amount, and no member appears anywhere: the
 * server counts people and never names them.
