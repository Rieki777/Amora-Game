/**
 * MobileTabBar: five-slot bottom nav, mobile only.
 *
 * Slots come from config/mobileNav.ts. The last one dispatches
 * "open-mobile-menu", which Layout listens for and opens the existing header
 * drawer, so there is one nav menu in the app rather than two that drift apart.
 *
 * Ported from regen-civics. Two details from that implementation are carried
 * over deliberately because both were bug fixes, not decoration:
 *
 *  - It portals to <body>. A `position: fixed` element is positioned against
 *    the nearest ancestor that has a transform, filter, backdrop-filter or
 *    contain, not against the viewport. Any of those on a parent silently turns
 *    this bar into an absolutely-positioned strip floating mid-page.
 *  - It pads for env(safe-area-inset-bottom) so the bar clears the iOS home
 *    indicator.
