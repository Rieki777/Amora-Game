/**
 * THE SETUP WIZARD'S IDENTITY STEP, RENDERED, because "the two boxes are gone"
 * is a claim about a screen and the only honest way to check a screen is to
 * draw it.
 *
 * What was wrong with those boxes: "Recognition currency name" and "Currency,
 * lowercase" wrote `brand.currency`, and `mergedConfig()` (server/index.ts)
 * computes `pick(registryName, pick(brandName, configName))` for that name.
 * `drizzle/0006` always seeds a name into `tokens`, so `registryName` is never
 * blank and the brand field never won. `nameLower` is derived from the winning
 * name and had no read path at all. A founder could type in either box, see
 * "Saved", and change nothing anybody could read.
 *
 * So this test asks the rendered step three things: neither label is on the
 * screen, the replacement line is, and pressing it opens the Tokens tab. The
 * first two would both pass on a blank screen, which is why the third is here.
 *
 * `fetch` is stubbed. The panels this step embeds (look, typography, identity
 * pack) each fetch on mount and each tolerate a refusal, so one catch-all stub
 * that answers the brand document and says no to everything else is enough to
 * draw the step without pretending to be a server.
