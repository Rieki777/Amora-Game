/**
 * The homes this village offers (0131): the other half of the housing tab.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS EXISTS TO END ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `client/src/pages/Housing.tsx` carried four home tiers as a module
 * constant, names and square footages and USD price bands, with a "Reserve
 * this home" button under each. `client/src/pages/ReserveHome.tsx` carried a
 * second copy of the same four sizes, worded differently for the same homes.
 * `/housing` is not module-gated, so EVERY village that deploys this platform
 * published those American figures under its own name, to prospective
 * residents, and no admin field anywhere could change one of them. Read live
 * on 2026-09-02 at a Costa Rican village publishing dollars and square feet
 * nobody there chose. This panel is the field that was missing.
 *
 * ── SELF-CONTAINED, AND MOUNTED IN ONE LINE ──────────────────────────────
 * Same reason HousingAdminPanel gives for its own existence: Admin.tsx is a
 * large file other workstreams edit and it carries a hard line ratchet, so
 * the mount is one line. It is a sibling of HousingAdminPanel rather than a
 * section inside it because that file is read as TEXT by
 * client/src/lib/housingForm.test.ts, which asserts on the shape of its
 * hamlet list, and growing a second feature inside it puts those assertions
 * and this feature in each other's way for no gain.
 *
 * ── EVERY BOX IS FREE TEXT, AND SENDS ONLY ITSELF ────────────────────────
 * Nothing here is a number input, and nothing supplies a currency symbol, a
 * unit, a conversion or a rounding. A village writes "0.5 hectares" or "45
 * m2" in size, and "45,000,000 colones" or "80k to 150k" or "ask us" in
 * price, and that is exactly what publishes. A sibling lane spent a day on
 * the mirror of this defect, a page asserting "Total Acres" over a figure a
 * founder meant as hectares.
 *
 * Each control sends the ONE field it owns, built by `homePatch` in
 * @/lib/housingForm where a test can run it, because a control that sends one
 * field cannot revert the four it never mentioned. An emptied box sends null
 * and clears the column, which is how a home is unpublished.
 *
 * ── THE BOXES ARE UNCONTROLLED, ON PURPOSE ───────────────────────────────
 * Same trade as the hamlet rows: a half-typed value survives a refresh that
 * lands mid-edit, at the cost of a value changed elsewhere not appearing in
 * the box until the tab is reopened. The badge and the heading DO update, and
 * no write is made from what a box holds unless a founder edits it, so a
 * stale box cannot become a stale write.

 * will leave it. An "e.g. 1,200 sq ft" hint would put the defect this panel
 * removes back into the panel that removes it, wearing an example's clothes.
