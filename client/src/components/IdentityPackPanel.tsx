/**
 * Admin → Make This Yours → Identity pack: the village's visual identity as
 * DATA, a description of what they are and aren't, plus reference files, so
 * that when the design agency lands, generation has something to be
 * consistent WITH beyond the three Look decisions.
 *
 * The rights acknowledgment gates the SAVE, not just the UI, by the same
 * reasoning as the font licence: a logo from a designer often isn't the
 * village's to feed a model (Rye, 2026-08-01: villages hold rights to their
 * images, and regenerate base art only with their own API key). Recording
 * who confirmed, and when, is what makes that policy real later.
 *
 * ── REFERENCE FILES, NOT REFERENCE IMAGES ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Rye, 2026-09-02: "The identity pack should be able to handle all sorts of
 * file types. In this case I'm trying to upload an HTML that shows the whole
 * style guide." A designer hands over a style guide as a web page far more
 * often than as a picture of one, so the door takes HTML, CSS, SVG, PDF and
 * markdown alongside photographs. The label moved with the capability: a
 * control called "Reference images" that accepts an HTML file is a control
 * that lies about itself, and the rights line under it was making the same
 * claim about the same files.
 *
 * ── THE PICKER IS A BUTTON ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Rye, same day: "this 'choose file' needs to be a much more obvious button!
 * The 'add reference' shouldn't appear until I choose a file." This was a
 * bare `<input type="file">`, which every browser draws differently and every
 * phone draws small, sitting next to an Add reference button that was live
 * before there was anything to add. So the input is `sr-only` behind a
 * styled label (still focusable, still announced, so the keyboard and the
 * screen reader lose nothing), the chosen filename is shown once there is
 * one, and Add reference exists only when pressing it would do something.
