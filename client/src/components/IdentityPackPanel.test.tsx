/**
 * The identity pack's picker, asserted as a founder meets it.
 *
 * Two sentences from Rye opened this work, and each one is a test below,
 * because both describe something you can only see by rendering the panel:
 *
 *   "this 'choose file' needs to be a much more obvious button! The 'add
 *    reference' shouldn't appear until I choose a file."
 *   "The identity pack should be able to handle all sorts of file types. In
 *    this case I'm trying to upload an HTML that shows the whole style guide."
 *
 * WHY A COMPONENT TEST AND NOT A SCREENSHOT. A screenshot proves a button was
 * drawn once on one machine and cannot be re-checked by anybody later. These
 * assertions run on every commit and fail on the exact regression that would
 * matter: Add reference coming back before there is anything to add, the
 * picker sliding back to a bare input, or the label reverting to a promise
 * about images the door no longer keeps.
 *
 * `fetch` is stubbed. The route behind it has its own suite over real HTTP
 * against a real volume (server/routes/brandUploads.test.ts); what is under
 * test here is what the founder can see and press.
