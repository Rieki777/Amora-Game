/**
 * Build the server bundle, stamping the git SHA into it.
 *
 * The build marker used to be a hand-edited string, so it was accurate only
 * when somebody remembered. Six commits once shipped under a stale one and
 * /health cheerfully reported an old build while new code served. The marker
 * is load-bearing — the launch registry reads it, FORK_RUNBOOK tells forks to
 * verify a deploy with it, and the feedback relay sends it upstream as the
 * identity of the deployment a bug came from — so it must not depend on
 * discipline.
 *
 * Railway builds from a git checkout, so `git rev-parse` is available there.
 * Where it is not (a tarball, a Docker layer without .git), the marker falls
 * back to "dev" rather than guessing: an honest "unknown" beats a confident
 * wrong answer about which code is running.

 * THE RECEIPT THAT SAYS WHAT THIS BUNDLE WAS BUILT FROM.
 *
 * Every e2e suite in this tree checks that dist/index.js EXISTS and stops
 * there. None of them checked that it was CURRENT, so editing server source
 * and running the suite without rebuilding returned a verdict on yesterday's
 * bytes: green on code that is not the code in the tree. Reproduced in four
 * minutes, both directions, 2026-08-31.
 *
 * The check cannot be "dist newer than everything in the repo": a README edit,
 * a test file, or a branch switch would all trip it, and a check that cries
 * wolf gets deleted. So the bundle is compared only against its OWN inputs,
 * taken from esbuild's own graph rather than from a guess, plus the lockfile
 * (the build is `packages: "external"`, so a `pnpm install` after a build
 * changes the code that runs while leaving every bundle input untouched).
 *
 * The CLIENT half is written separately, by scripts/build-client-manifest.mjs,
 * right after vite builds. It has to be: this script is routinely run on its
 * own during an inner loop, and if it also stamped the client inputs it would
 * be certifying a bundle it had not rebuilt.
 *
 * mtime is recorded as a fast pre-filter; the hash is the verdict, because
 * `git checkout` and `git worktree add` rewrite mtimes on files whose bytes
 * end up identical to what the bundle was built from.
