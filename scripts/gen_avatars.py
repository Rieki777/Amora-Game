"""Character card portraits for the class selection page.

Five classes x two presentations x three skin tones = 30 card portraits at
`client/public/images/avatars/<archetype>-<f|m>-<tone>.webp`.

The style guide is reused verbatim from the platform repo's character-art
prompt: solarpunk meets elven meets regenerative future, deep forest greens,
warm golds, bioluminescent teals, sunrise amber light, grown tools, living
fibers. Card portrait means three-quarter body on a soft warm green-to-gold
gradient, no text, no scene elements, clean edges for compositing.

Four properties this pipeline is built around, each of which was a real
failure mode somewhere else:

  1. RESUME-SAFE. An output that already exists is skipped. A run that dies
     at asset 19 picks up at 19, and costs nothing for the 18 before it.
  2. THE BASE IS SAVED. Each (class, presentation) has ONE generated base
     PNG on disk. The other two skin tones are EDITS of that exact file, so
     a resumed run derives its tone variants from the same face it started
     with instead of a freshly generated stranger.
  3. THE MODEL IS PINNED, and there is NO fallback list. A pipeline that
     quietly drops to a weaker model on a bad afternoon produces a set that
     does not match itself, and nothing in the output says so. On a 429 this
     backs off and retries; on anything else it stops and says why.
  4. THE MANIFEST IS THE TRUTH. Every asset records the model that made it,
     the base it came from, and when. The selection page reads the manifest
     and falls back to a medallion for anything missing, so a half-finished
     run renders as a half-finished run and never as a broken image.

Usage:

    GEMINI_API_KEY=...  python scripts/gen_avatars.py --samples
    GEMINI_API_KEY=...  python scripts/gen_avatars.py
    GEMINI_API_KEY=...  python scripts/gen_avatars.py building storytelling
    GEMINI_API_KEY=...  python scripts/gen_avatars.py --dry-run

`--samples` generates exactly the three blessing samples and stops, which is
the gate before the full thirty. The key comes from the environment only and
is never written to disk, a log line, or the manifest.
