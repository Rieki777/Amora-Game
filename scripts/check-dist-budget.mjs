/**
 * The bundle budget, measured the way CI measures it.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The budget lived as a shell block in
 * `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and CLAUDE.md said "nothing local reproduces
 * them". That was true, and it cost a lane a full session: the workflow sizes
 * `dist/public` with `du -sk`, and `du` reports ALLOCATED BLOCKS. On the ext4
 * filesystem GitHub runners use, every file consumes a whole 4096-byte block,
 * so a 300-byte chunk costs 4 KB and a 4100-byte chunk costs 8 KB. Add up the
 * rounding across a tree with a hundred small files and the gate reads about
 * 700 KB heavier than the bytes actually on disk. A lane that measured real
 * bytes locally saw headroom that CI did not have.
 *
 * THE COUNTER-INTUITIVE PART, and the reason this is worth a script instead of
 * a comment: the two budgets pull in opposite directions.
 *
 *   MAX_MAIN_JS_KB is REAL BYTES on one file. Splitting a route out of the
 *   main chunk makes that number fall. Splitting is the fix.
 *   MAX_TOTAL_DIST_KB is BLOCK-CHARGED bytes across the tree. Splitting a
 *   4 KB module into its own chunk adds a whole block whatever the module
 *   weighs, so splitting makes that number RISE. Merging is the fix.
 *
 * A build tuned only for the first budget quietly spends the second. This
 * script prints both so the trade is visible before a push, and it names the
 * files paying the most padding so the next lane knows where to look.
 *
 * WHAT IT MEASURES, precisely, so the arithmetic can be checked by hand:
 *   real bytes      sum of file sizes.
 *   block-charged   sum of ceil(size / 4096) * 4096 over files, plus what each
 *                   directory costs. Empty files cost nothing, which is what
 *                   `du` reports for them.
 *
 * A DIRECTORY IS NOT ALWAYS ONE BLOCK, which is the detail that made a first
 * version of this read 8 KB light. ext4 stores directory entries in 4 KB
 * blocks and grows past one once the names stop fitting, then adds an htree
 * index block on top. `dist/public/assets` holds about 120 hashed filenames
 * and measures 12288 bytes on ext4, three blocks where the other five
 * directories in the tree take one each. So directories are costed from their
 * entry names here, the same way the filesystem does it. Checked against a
 * real ext4 volume: `du -sk` said 5432 KB and this says 5432 KB.
 *
 * The numbers come off `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, which CLAUDE.md names as
 * the authority for them, so this script cannot drift from the gate by holding
 * a stale copy. Environment variables override for a what-if run.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/check-dist-budget.mjs           # the gate, plus the report
 *   node scripts/check-dist-budget.mjs --report  # measure only, always exit 0
 *   node scripts/check-dist-budget.mjs --json    # machine readable
 *
 * Read the exit code. A failing run prints `::error::` lines that GitHub lifts
 * into the run summary, and those are not reliably the last line on a
 * terminal.

 * What one directory costs on ext4, from the names it holds.
 *
 * Each entry is an 8-byte header plus the name rounded up to a multiple of 4,
 * and the first block also carries `.` and `..`. A small directory is one
 * linear block. Once the entries stop fitting, ext4 switches to an htree: one
 * index block above some number of leaf blocks.
 *
 * The leaves are the part worth explaining. An htree splits a leaf by HASH
 * RANGE and not by fill, so leaves sit partly empty and counting bytes as
 * though they packed tight reads a block light. LEAF_FILL is where that lands
 * in practice, and it is pinned tighter than it looks: on the trees checked
 * here 7100 bytes of entries took two leaves and 8044 took three, which puts
 * the boundary between 0.867 and 0.982, and 0.9 sits inside it.
 *
 * This is a model of a filesystem, so treat it as accurate to about one block
 * per large directory. It matched `du -sk` exactly on four different built
 * trees, and CI still runs `du` beside it as the authority.
