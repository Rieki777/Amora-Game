/**
 * The image gate: format, per-file size, and a total that may only fall.
 *
 * WHAT WAS ALREADY WATCHED, AND WHAT WAS NOT. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` caps
 * any single file in `dist/public` at 400 KB and the whole directory at 6 MB,
 * and `scripts/check-artifact-budget.mjs` watches the living map. Between them
 * they miss the two things that actually decide what a phone downloads:
 *
 *   FORMAT. Nothing stopped a PNG landing in `client/public`. WebP is the
 *   house standard for raster art and it was a convention, which is to say it
 *   held until someone was in a hurry.
 *   DIRECTION. The bundle budget is a CEILING (6600 KB on dist/public since
 *   R33; the tree sat at 6136 KB when that was set), so images can still grow
 *   by several hundred KB and stay green. A ceiling tells you about a
 *   catastrophe; it says nothing about a year of quiet accumulation.
 *
 * So this is a RATCHET on the total, the same discipline as
 * `scripts/brand-refs-baseline.json`: the number in
 * `scripts/image-budget-baseline.json` may only ever go DOWN, and
 * `--update-baseline` refuses to raise it. Art that genuinely needs to grow
 * goes in the uploads volume, which is hashed, cached correctly, swappable,
 * and outside this budget by design.
 *
 * WHY IT RUNS BEFORE THE BUILD. It reads files in the repo, so a wrong format
 * fails in a second instead of after `pnpm build` and `pnpm test`. Same reason
 * the artifact budget sits where it does.
 *
 * THE NON-WEBP ALLOWLIST IS A RULE, NOT A LIST OF NAMES. Two reasons. A list
 * of filenames would be a list of one village's brand assets living in
 * `scripts/`, which the brand ratchet correctly refuses; and a fork with its
 * own icon would have to edit this file to stay green. So the exempt files are
 * DERIVED: whatever `shared/gameConfig.ts` calls the favicon, and whatever
 * `client/index.html` hands to a browser or a link preview as an icon or a
 * social card. Those surfaces have no dependable WebP support, and the PWA
 * manifest additionally labels any non-SVG icon `image/png` from an
 * `endsWith(".svg")` ternary in server/index.ts. Everything else is WebP.
 *
 * ── THE COUPLING CHECK, AND THE FAILURE THAT PAID FOR IT ────────────────────
 *
 * Deriving the exemption from a config field made the exemption move when the
 * field moved, and for a while nothing said so out loud. On 2026-08-30 the
 * neutralisation lane blanked `images.favicon` in `shared/gameConfig.ts`, which
 * silently revoked the exemption keyed off it. This gate went red, and it went
 * red naming `client/public/assets/images/Amora-2-Green1.png`, a file that
 * commit had not touched, for being the wrong format. The cheapest way back to
 * green was to delete the file, so commit 452ab2b did (its own message records
 * the chain). The gate was working. It named the wrong noun, and the wrong noun
 * is what got acted on.
 *
 * A declaration and the file it names are ONE fact written in two places, so
 * this gate now refuses to let the two places disagree, in both directions:
 *
 *   DANGLING (declaration without a file). A declared path that resolves
 *     nowhere fails. Deleting the art while the config still points at it is
 *     now a red, instead of a broken icon nobody sees.
 *   ORPHANED (file without a declaration). An image in `client/public` that
 *     nothing in the repo references fails, and the message reports which
 *     declaration slots are currently sitting empty, because a slot that went
 *     empty is the usual reason a file just became unreferenced.
 *
 * Blanking a field and deleting the file it named are the same change. They
 * belong in one commit, and either half on its own is now a failure that says
 * which half is missing.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/check-image-budget.mjs                    # the gate
 *   node scripts/check-image-budget.mjs --json             # machine readable
 *   node scripts/check-image-budget.mjs --update-baseline  # only ever downward
 *
 * Read the exit code. A passing run prints a total; a failing one prints
 * ::error:: lines, and neither is reliably the last line on the terminal.
