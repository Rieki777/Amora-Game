/**
 * The auth guard: a client call to a route that REFUSES strangers carries a token.
 *
 * ── THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The Living Map's promise relay was written with a plain `fetch` and a
 * Content-Type header. It shipped through ten passing route tests, because
 * every one of them set `Authorization` itself, and it would have told every
 * signed-in member on the map that they were anonymous: this deployment
 * authenticates by `Authorization: Bearer` ALONE (`authedUser` in
 * server/index.ts), with no cookie fallback, so a request without the header
 * is not a member's request. Nothing threw. Nothing logged. The map simply
 * offered people a way in they did not need.
 *
 * A server test proves the route. It does not prove the client reaches it.
 * This is the static half of that gap, so it costs nothing and cannot flake.
 *
 * ── WHY IT READS THE SERVER INSTEAD OF HOLDING A LIST ────────────────────
 * The first draft flagged every client `fetch` to `/api/...` without a token
 * and found 84, nearly all of them correct: `/api/season` and `/api/quests`
 * answer a stranger on purpose, and `/api/library` reads the viewer only to
 * decide how much to show. A guard that cries at correct code gets waived,
 * and a waived guard is worse than none.
 *
 * So the rule is derived from the routes themselves. A route that says
 *
 *     const user = await authedUser(req);
 *     if (!user) return res.status(401).json(...)
 *
 * has DECLARED that a stranger gets nothing, and a client call to it without
 * a token is always a bug. Everything else is left alone. When a route starts
 * or stops refusing strangers, this guard follows on its own, with no list to
 * update and no chance of the list going stale in the direction that hides a
 * problem.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/check-auth-fetch.mjs [--json]
