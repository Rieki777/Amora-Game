/**
 * The village-fact guard's own guard.
 *
 * Two things are being proved, and the second matters more than the first.
 *
 * IT REFUSES. A new price, a new token name in display text, a grown count, a
 * file nobody listed, and a listed count that has been cleaned and not
 * delisted all fail, and the failure names the file and the line. Every one of
 * those runs the REAL script as a child process against a fixture tree and
 * reads the exit code.
 *
 * IT DOES NOT CRY WOLF. Every refusal is paired with a positive control that
 * has to come back clean, because a guard that flagged everything would pass
 * the refusal half of this file perfectly. The allow cases are the ones the
 * brief named as most likely to make a guard wrong: a route path, a component
 * name, a comment, a database column, a source tag, a test fixture, and a
 * ProjectHistory entry recording the token-naming decision itself.
 *
 * WHY THE FIXTURES RUN THE REAL SCRIPT. check-identity-keys.test.mjs copies
 * the guard into each fixture tree, which works because that guard imports
 * nothing. This one imports typescript, and a copy in os.tmpdir() cannot
 * resolve it. So the script takes `--root` and `--pending` and is driven in
 * place. That is better anyway: a copy is a second implementation, and the
 * thing worth proving is that the file CI runs refuses.
 *
 * The fixture villages and people are invented. A test that had to name a real
 * village or a real person to work would be the same mistake it is testing
 * for.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/check-village-facts.test.mjs
